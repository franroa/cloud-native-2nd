Frontend to Person and Connection Services:
As this is an mvp, we don't strictly need to change the protocol used for the frontend: the number of calls to the
connection and person services are not expected to be so hugh, so we can stay with the RESTful protocol for that communication.

Location Service:
The location service will get information from the mobiles around, and will be ingesting a hugh amount of data,
so I would refactor two things here: I would use gRPC for the communication with the location services, a protocol
able to process a higher amount of data than RESTful can. I would also decouple the calls inserting the data into the
database for preventing data congestion when writing data into the database by leveraging kafka queues.
